# ZeroTrustBounty

## Overview
- Uses TLS Notary and Lit protocol for trustless bugbounty reports
- TLS notary cryptographically attests to proof of a vulnerability like SQL injection
- The Exploit payload gets encrypted using LIT protocol and can be downloaded by the company after access control checks which could be based on on chain attributes like holding an NFT / Signer of a Gnosis safe etc
- This establishes a trustless bugbounty reporting and payment mechanism and elemates bug stealing by centalized platforms and ensures whitehats get paid before vulnerability is fully disclosed.
